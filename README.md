IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a cybersecurity tool designed to monitor network traffic or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. It identifies potential threats and alerts administrators about suspicious behavior. There are two primary types of IDS:

Network-based IDS (NIDS):

Monitors network traffic.
Analyzes data packets to detect threats like unauthorized access, malicious payloads, or abnormal traffic patterns.
Host-based IDS (HIDS):

Monitors activity on individual devices or hosts.
Examines system logs, file changes, and user activities to detect unusual behavior.
Key Features:
Signature-based Detection: Compares traffic or activities against a database of known attack patterns (signatures).
Anomaly-based Detection: Identifies deviations from normal behavior, which may indicate new or unknown threats.
Real-time Alerts: Provides immediate notifications when potential threats are detected.
Log Analysis: Offers detailed information about incidents for forensic investigation.
Use Cases:
Detecting unauthorized access attempts.
Identifying malware and other cyber threats.
Monitoring compliance with security policies.
Supporting incident response efforts.
IDS systems can be integrated with Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) for automated response to threats, creating a robust security framework.
